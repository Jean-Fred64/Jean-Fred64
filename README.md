### Bonjour, ðŸ‘‹

I'm not an electronics engineer,
I like fixing old stuff and using KiCAD and a soldering iron as a hobby.
I like to get my hands under the hood of circuit boards of things I've seen.
I often build them so I can have one and share it with friends.

The files here are from different repositories.
âš¡ Guaranteed, there is no .... until the gate.
